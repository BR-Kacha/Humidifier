# Humidity Controller for Fungus and Bacteria Cultures

This project is a humidity controller device that can measure and maintain the humidity and temperature of a BOD Incubator where different fungus and bacteria cultures are grown. The device ensures the humidity remains within a decided range by automatically controlling a humidifier.

## Features
- Measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor
- Automatically controls a humidifier to maintain desired humidity levels
- Operates in pulse mode or continuous mode based on the humidity level

## Components
- Arduino UNO R3
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Relay Module (for controlling the humidifier)
- LED (for indication)
- Wires and Breadboard
- Power Supply
- Humidifier
